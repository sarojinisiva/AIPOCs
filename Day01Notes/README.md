# ðŸ¤– AI Concepts Overview

This repository provides a brief overview of key Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts, including Traditional AI, Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs), along with their common use cases.

## 1. Traditional AI

**Definition:**  
Traditional AI refers to rule-based systems and classical machine learning models that operate on structured data using predefined logic. These models are typically designed to perform specific, narrow tasks.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Email spam filtering  
- Credit card fraud detection  
- Recommendation engines  
- Rule-based chatbots  
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  
- Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

## 2. Generative AI

**Definition:**  
Generative AI involves AI models capable of generating new content such as text, images, audio, video, or code. These models learn from large datasets and simulate human-like creativity.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Content writing (e.g., ChatGPT)  
- Image generation (e.g., DALLÂ·E, MidJourney)  
- Code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)  
- Conversational agents  
- Synthetic data generation  
- Music and video generation

## 3. LLM (Large Language Model)

**Definition:**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on vast corpora of text. They understand and generate human-like language using transformer-based architectures.

**Examples of LLMs:**
- GPT (OpenAI)  
- BERT (Google)  
- Claude (Anthropic)  
- LLaMA (Meta)

**Applications:**
- Natural language understanding  
- Virtual assistants  
- Text summarization and translation  
- Semantic search  
- Automated code completion
